GazeCam Unity Sample
====
<p>

Introduction
----

This is an example of how to incorporate eye control into a 3D scenario. The sample shows how to employ the [EyeTribe C# SDK](https://github.com/EyeTribe/tet-csharp-client) in a simple scene set up in the [Unity game engine](http://unity3d.com/).

The sample allows the user to do a full calibration of the EyeTribe Server and interact with a 3D scene. In this scene, the user will be able to control main camera with head movement and highlight 3d objects by looking at them.
